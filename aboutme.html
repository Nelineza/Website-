            <p> Hello! For those who don't know me, my name is Valentyna Dos Santos. I'm a professional makeup artist who lives in Belgium, the country known for its delicious fries, waffles, chocolate, beer and more! </p>
            <p> I speak french, dutch, portuguese, english and spanish. </p>
            <p> I have been in the makeup industry for about 4 years now. I do face makeup and body painting. I work at NYX Professional Makeup in Brussels. I absolutely love working there because makeup is my passion. Makeup is truly the love of my life! I live makeup, sleep makeup, breathe makeup... Makeup means everything to me.</p>
            <p> I work with professional models and photographers. However anyone can be my client.</p>
            <p> Funny enough I don't like doing my own makeup. I just find it boring. But i absolutely LOVE doing other people's makeup. What makes me the happiest is seeing the smile on people's faces after I'm done doing there makeup look! When I see my clients looking at themselves with a smile and taking selfies etc. I get very happy. Their satisfactoin and happiness brings me joy.</p>
            <p> I like using different types of makeup products. High-brand product, drugstore products, doesn't matter!</p>
            <p> I am looking forward to hopefully do your makeup.</p>
